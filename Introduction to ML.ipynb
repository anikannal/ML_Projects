    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at each of steps in further detail - \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define Project Objectives** - this is very important step that most of us tend to forget. Without a clear understand of why you are doing any project, the project will fail. What the business or clients expects as outcome of the project has to be discussed and understood before you start off.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Acquire, Explore, and Prepare Data** - you will spend a lot of your time on this step when you do an ML project. This is a critical step - exploring the data will help you decide which models you might want to employ, based this preliminary hypothesis you will prepare the data for the next step (Model Data). Here are a few things you will end up doing within this step - \n",
    "    - Data acquisition and loading\n",
    "    - Data integration\n",
    "    - Exploratory data analysis\n",
    "    - Data cleaning\n",
    "    - Feature selection\n",
    "    - Encoding\n",
    "    - Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Data** - this is the heart of our project. But, most students of ML get stuck on fancy algorithm names. There's a lot more to it than just claiming that you have done a project using SVM or Logistic Regression. You have to be able to articulate how you picked a model, how you trained it, and why did you conclude that the output looks good.\n",
    "    - Select the algorithm(s) to use\n",
    "    - Train the model(s)\n",
    "    - Evaluate performance\n",
    "    - Tweak parameters and re-evaluate\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interpret and Communicate the Insights** - just modeling the data, showing a few visualizations, and reducing the error is not enough. As an ML engineer you have to be able to talk to your client and help them interpret the outcome of all your hard work. Be ready to answer a few questions - \n",
    "    - What interesting patterns did you notice in the data?\n",
    "    - Did you notice any intrinsic dependencies, correlation, or causation in the features?\n",
    "    - Why did you pick the algorithm that you did?\n",
    "    - How did you split the train-test data? why?\n",
    "    - Is this error rate acceptable? why?\n",
    "    - How will the outcome of this project help the client?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Implement, Document, and Maintain** - at a real client, you will have to deploy your model in production, document it extensively, and also maintain it going forward. We will not go into this step given we are not going to be deploying our models in production.\n"
