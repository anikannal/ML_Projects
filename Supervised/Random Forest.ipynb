    "\n",
    "Random forest is a supervised learning algorithm. The \"forest\" it builds, is an collection of decision trees, usually trained with the “bagging” method. The general idea of the bagging method is that a combination of learning models increases the overall result.\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e. random forest builds multiple decision trees and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is one of the most used algorithms, because of its simplicity and diversity (it can be used for both classification and regression tasks)."

    "## Why Random Forest?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why go to the trouble of creating a forest of decision trees when a single decision tree already works? \n",
    "\n",
    "Trees are easy to build, easy to use, and easy to interpret BUT they are not very accurate. Decision Trees have some intrinsic limitations that a Random Forest helps to address - Decision Trees are prone to overfitting - i.e. they work great with training data but their accuracy is not so great with classifying new samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forests combine the simplicity of Decision Trees with flexibility to deliver a vast improvement in accuracy."

    "- In finance, for example, it is used to detect customers more likely to repay their debt on time, or use a bank's services more frequently\n",
    "- In insurance and credit card industry to detect fraudulent transactions\n",
    "- In trading, the algorithm can be used to determine a stock's future behavior\n",
    "- In the healthcare domain it is used to identify the correct combination of components in medicine and to analyze a patient’s medical history to identify diseases\n",
