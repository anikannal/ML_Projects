    "Naive Bayes is among one of the most simple and powerful algorithms for classification based on Bayes’ Theorem with an assumption of independence among predictors/features. Naive Bayes model is easy to build and particularly useful for very large data sets. There are two parts to this algorithm:\n",

    "The Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a feature in a class is unrelated to any other feature. Even if these features depend on each other or upon the existence of the other features, all of these properties independently contribute to the probability that a particular fruit is an apple or an orange or a banana and that is why it is known as “Naive”.

    "Spam detection is one of the major applications of Machine Learning in the interwebs today. Pretty much all of the major email service providers have spam detection systems built in and automatically classify such mail as 'Junk Mail'.\n",

    "In this mission we will be using the Naive Bayes algorithm to create a model that can classify SMS messages as spam or not spam, based on the training we give to the model. It is important to have some level of intuition as to what a spammy text message might look like. Usually they have words like 'free', 'win', 'winner', 'cash', 'prize' and the like in them as these texts are designed to catch your eye and in some sense tempt you to open them. Also, spam messages tend to have words written in all capitals and also tend to use a lot of exclamation marks. To the recipient, it is usually pretty straightforward to identify a spam text and our objective here is to train a model to do that for us!\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to identify spam messages is a binary classification problem as messages are classified as either 'Spam' or 'Not Spam' and nothing else. Also, this is a supervised learning problem, as we will be feeding a labelled dataset into the model, that it can learn from, to make future predictions.\n",

    "**Accuracy** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam. It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",

    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score.\n",

    "## Advantages of Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "- One of the major advantages that Naive Bayes has over other classification algorithms is its ability to handle an extremely large number of features. In our case, each word is treated as a feature and there are thousands of different words.\n",
    "- It performs well even with the presence of irrelevant features and is relatively unaffected by them. \n",
    "- The other major advantage it has is its relative simplicity. Naive Bayes' works well right out of the box and tuning it's parameters is rarely ever necessary, except usually in cases where the distribution of the data is known. \n",
    "- It rarely ever overfits the data. \n",
    "- Another important advantage is that its model training and prediction times are very fast for the amount of data it can handle. \n",
